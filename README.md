## Summary
The survivor tank is a 3D shooting game. You control a tank and need to fend off enemy invasion to your military base as much as possible.
You drive around, shoot different types of enemy tanks, collect bonuses and try to avoid penalties.
The game's goal is to get as many points as possible because eventually you meet your demise.

I developed the game as a final project for a Video Game Development course I took during a student exchange program. The game was developed in Unity and written in C#.

## How to play
You will be spawned in the middle of your military base. Use the arrow keys to turn around and drive forward and backward. When you encounter an enemy tank use the space bar to shoot a bullet. Bonuses like better weapons and life will appear for a short time so drive fast to collect them. On the other hand, penalties like bombs and stones from the sky also will appear so drive even faster to avoid them.

## Installation
To run this game, on GitHub navigate to the main page of the repository. To the right of the list of files, click Releases and download the latest release of the game. Another option is to download the GitHub zip file or clone the repository. Open it on Unity and run the game.

## More details about the game
You score points by destroying enemy tanks. During the games events will be spawned in random places on the map. The events usually will appear for a limited time and then disappear. The more you survive the invasion, the changes of getting good events go down, while the changes of getting bad events go up. Therefore, eventually you meet your demise. 

<ins>The good events are:</ins>
- Stronger Weapon - allow your tank to shoot faster for a limited time.
- Life - an item in shape of heart that fix and give more life to your tank.
- Shield - A magical shield that makes your tank invulnerable for a limited time. It's not easy to catch this item because it's running away from you, but once you do it your tank will start blinking.

<ins>The bad events are:</ins>
- Puddles - if you get into a puddle, the tank engine will break down for a while and your control keys will be flipped.
- Rocks - the military base is located next to mountains, so be carfull from rocks fall from it.
- TNT Bomb - If you happen to be near one of these bombs, move away quickly because it causes a significant damage.
- Enemy - a red enemy tank that invades to your military base.
- Boss Enemy - a blue big enemy tank. This tank has more life and a stronger weapon, but it's worth more points if you destroy it.
