# The Survivor Tank Game
## Summary
The survivor tank is a 3D shooting game. You control a tank and need to fend off enemy invasion to your base as much as possible.
You drive around, shoot different types of enemy tanks, collect bonuses and try to avoid penalties.
The game's goal is to get as many points as possible becuase eventually you meet your demise.

I developed this game as a final project for a Video Game Development course I took during an exchange students program. The game was developed in Unity and written in C#.

## How to play
You will be spawned in the middle of your military base. Use the arrow keys to turn around and drive forward and backward. When you encounter an enemy tank use the space bar to shoot a bullet. Bonuses like better weapons and life will appear for a short time so drive fast to collect them. On the other hand, penalties like bombs and stones from the sky also will appear so drive even faster to avoid them.
