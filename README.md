# The Survivor Tank Game
## Summary
The survivor tank is a 3D shooting game. You control a tank and need to fend off enemy invasion to your military base as much as possible.
You drive around, shoot different types of enemy tanks, collect bonuses and try to avoid penalties.
The game's goal is to get as many points as possible because eventually you meet your demise.

I developed the game as a final project for a Video Game Development course I took during an exchange students program. The game was developed in Unity and written in C#.

## How to play
You will be spawned in the middle of your military base. Use the arrow keys to turn around and drive forward and backward. When you encounter an enemy tank use the space bar to shoot a bullet. Bonuses like better weapons and life will appear for a short time so drive fast to collect them. On the other hand, penalties like bombs and stones from the sky also will appear so drive even faster to avoid them.

## Installation

## More details about the game
During the games events will be spawned in random places on the map. Some events are good and some are bad.

The good events are:
- Stronger Weapon - allow your tank to shoot faster.
- Life - an item in shape of heart that fix and give more life to your tank.
- Shield - A magical shield that makes your tank invulnerable for a limited time. It's not easy to catch this item because it's running away from you, but once you do it your tank will start blinking.

The bad events are:
- Puddles - if you get into a puddle, the tank engine will break down for a while and your control keys will be flipped.
- Rocks - the military base is located next to mountains, so be carfull from rocks fall from it.
- Tnt Bomb - If you happen to be near one of these bombs, move away quickly because it causes a significant damage.
- Enemy - a red enemy tank that invades to your military base.
- Boss Enemy - a blue big enemy tank. This tank has more life and a stronger weapon, but it's worth more points if you destroy it.
